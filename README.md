# Build a Basic CRUD App with Symfony 4 and Vue

This example shows how to use Symfony 4 and Vue to create a basic CRUD app for tracking the counts of various items (e.g. the number of times someone says 'Winter is coming' in Game of Thrones), using Okta to handle authentication.

Please read [...](https://developer.okta.com/blog/...) to see how this application was built.

**Prerequisites:** PHP, Node, [Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/)

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

## Getting Started

Sign up for an [Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com) and create a new application. Make note of the Client ID and Issuer values for your application.

Clone this project using the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:oktadeveloper/okta-php-symfony-vue-crud-example-2019
cd ...
```

### Set up the Backend

Create the database and user for the project:

```
mysql -uroot -p
CREATE DATABASE item_counter CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
GRANT ALL on item_counter.* to item_counter@127.0.0.1 identified by 'item_counter';
quit
```

Create a `.env.local` file:

```
cd item-counter-server
touch .env.local
```

Enter your database credentials and Okta credentials in the .env file:
```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://item_counter:item_counter@127.0.0.1:3306/item_counter
OKTA_CLIENT_ID=<ENTER YOUR OKTA CLIENT ID>
OKTA_URL=<ENTER YOUR OKTA ISSUER URL>
```

Install the project dependencies, run the migrations and then start the server:

```
composer install
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
```

Loading [127.0.0.1:8000](127.0.0.1:8000) now should show the default Symfony 4 page, and [127.0.0.1:8000/movies](127.0.0.1:8000/movies) should show you a 'Not authorized' message. NOTE: if using a virtual machine and NAT, you might need to run the server as `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t public` instead.

### Set up the Frontend

Edit the Okta configuration in `src/main.js` to fill in your client ID and other application details. (Refer to the [accompanying blog post](https://developer.okta.com/blog/...) for more details.) Then install the dependencies and run the server:

```
cd item-counter-client
yarn
yarn run serve
```

Loading [127.0.0.1:8080](127.0.0.1:8080) now should show you the application.
